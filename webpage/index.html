                Our app sends notifications. The idea is based on the concept that if you can unpack notifications from the app package you can send notifications as a developer or receive them as a user without downloading an app. In addition you can bring a singular paradigm for turning up or down the frequency of notifications received.
            </p><p>
                The idea is the create a relay app where users can sign up for notifications from various 3rd party notifiers. On a developer side we can include many of the things that make their app relevant for their users already, or their potential users. For instance we can request location access at a macro level and give access to it for notification senders. The idea is that our server will intercept notifications from the 3rd part developers, vet them to make sure we reduce spam and send them to users. We can also allow for algorithmic curating, such as a parring the number of notifications a user gets if they don't click on many of them. 
            </p><p>
                In addition we would love to have the ability to send notifications between users/friends and to allow for interaction with notifications with iOS's new interactive notifications.

                <li>Our Framework provides an app through which users can sign up for our services.</li>
                <li>Our Framework provides assignment of API keys to third parties so third-parties can use our services.</li>
                <li>Our Framework supports two different types of notifications UserNotifications and DeveloperNotifications.</li>
                <li>Our Framework allows both notification types to be pushed to the receiving users' phones and show up in the receiving users' apps.</li>
                <li>Through the assigned API key, our Framework allows third party developers to send a DeveloperNotification to users by making a JSON request to our servers.</li>
                <li>Our Framework requires DeveloperNotification to be labeled with at least one hashtag and will forward the notification to the user base of each hashtag.</li>
                <li>Our Framework allows third parties to send notifications with different level of priority.</li>
                <li>Through the provided app, our framework allows users to sign up for notificiation from certain hashtags</li>
                <li>Through the provided app, our Framework allows users to forward (or send)  notification, and so creating a UserNotification, to other "trusted" users.</li>
                <li>Through the provided app, our Framework allows users to add users as "trusted" as well as delete users from their "trusted" list through.</li>
                <li>Through the provided app, our Framework allows users to limit the number of notification based on priority levels and/or location ranges.</li>
                <li>Through the provided app, our Framework allows users to modify notification sound per notification.</li>
                <li>Our Framework supports tracking of whether or not a user opened notifications.</li>

            <h3>Expanded Features</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Our Framework would allow specific sponsor notifications</li>
                <li>Our Framework would support combined notifications of distinct third party users</li>
                <li>Our Framework would allow third parties to send notification if users trip a geo-wire</li>
                <li>Through the provided app, our Framework allows users to add additional text or buttons to a forwarded notification when creating a UserNotification.</li>
                <li>Our Framework would display opening/closing statistics to third parties which third parties could use to improve their notifications.</li>

                Our application's front-end will be in the form of an iOS application.  Our server will serve as a front-end for developers from which they can create accounts, create and edit subscription lists, and view statistics for their subscription lists.

                We will use iOS front end for user interaction and most likely a web front end for Developer interaction. Django/JSON something of that sort, the developer site will be simple since it will just be a sign up sheet to get an API token. On the backend we will use a server and a database. The server will receive and send notifications with the database storing user information.
