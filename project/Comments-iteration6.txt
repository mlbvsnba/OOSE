Group 17,

Congratulations on a job well done.  You gave a good presentation of a
well-architected system and it seems you have a working beta of solution to a
real-world problem.  In future presentations, though, make sure to own up to
things that can be improved; your API key generation, for instance, was simply
arbitrary and no one would tell me that.  :)  You did a good job of picking up
several technologies and using them in a heterogeneous environment and your
final product is quite polished (with the exception of the pages which give the
IDs for developer streams and the like).

Total Score: 96/100
